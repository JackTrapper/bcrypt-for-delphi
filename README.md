Bcrypt for Delphi
==================

[Bcrypt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt) is an algorithm designed for hashing passwords, and only passwords; i.e. it is:

- **not** a high-speed, generic, hashing algorithm
- **not** a key derivation function (see [PBDKF2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2), [scrypt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt))
- computationally and memory expensive
- limited to passwords of 55 bytes

It was first [described by Niels Provos and David Mazi√®res in 1999](http://static.usenix.org/events/usenix99/provos/provos.pdf) for OpenBSD.

It uses the Blowfish encryption algorithm, but with an "expensive key setup" modification, contained in the function `EksBlowfishSetup`.

Sample Usage
----------------

- To hash a password:

        hash := TBCrypt.HashPassword('correct battery horse staple'); //using default cost factor
    
- To hash a password specifying your own cost factor:

        hash := TBCrypt.HashPassword('correct battery horse staple', 14); //specify cost factor 14
    
- To verify a password:

        isPasswordValid := TBCrypt.CheckPassword('correct battery horse stapler', expectedHash);


    
By convention BCrypt outputs a hash as string such as:

    $2a$11$EA6qjRCeBi8bGgs4rhfn8udEGKmu0ayrZYCEJqf6nNIoytowKFncm

The parts of the string are:

| Value | Meaning | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| 2a | Hash algorithm | "2a" = current version of BCrypt, "2" = obsolete version of BCrypt, "1" = MD5 |
| 11 | cost factor | Will iterate for 2<sup>11</sup>=2,048 rounds. (Default is 11) |
| Ro0CUfOqk6cXEKf3dyaM7O | Salt | 22 base64 encoded characters |
| hSCvnwM9s4wIX9JeLapehKK5YdLxKcm | Hashed password | 31 base64 encoded characters |

Because the **cost factor** is stored with the hash output, bcrypt hashes are backwards and forwards compatible with
	changing the number of rounds. It also makes BCrypt extraordinarily convenient in that a random salt is automatically generated and stored for you (you don't have to worry about storing or retrieving it).

Speed Tests
--------------

The current (3/21/2015) hard-coded default for cost is **11**. This results in 2<sup>11</sup> = 2,048 rounds during the key setup.

3/14/2015  Intel Core i5-2500 CPU @ 3.50 GHz Delphi XE6 (32-bit, Release)

| Cost | Iterations        |  Duration  |
|------|-------------------|------------|
|  8   |    256 iterations |    22.0 ms | <-- minimum allowed by BCrypt
|  9   |    512 iterations |    43.3 ms |
| 10   |  1,024 iterations |    85.5 ms |
| 11   |  2,048 iterations |   173.3 ms | <-- current default (BCRYPT_COST=11)
| 12   |  4,096 iterations |   345.6 ms |
| 13   |  8,192 iterations |   694.3 ms |
| 14   | 16,384 iterations | 1,390.5 ms |
| 15   | 32,768 iterations | 2,781.4 ms |
| 16   | 65,536 iterations | 5,564.9 ms |

At the time of publication (1999), the default cost was **6** for a normal user and **8** for the superuser.
